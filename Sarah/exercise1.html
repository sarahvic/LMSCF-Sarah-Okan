	<h3>Ingredients</h3>

	<hr>

	<ul>
		<li>3 Egg Whites</li>
		<li>1 Pinch of Salt</li>
		<li>1 Cup of White Sugar</li>
		<li>1 Tablespoon Cornstarch</li>
		<li>1 Teaspoon Lemon Juice</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Directions</h3>

	<hr>

	<ol>
		<li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Draw a 9 inch circle on the parchment. An easy way to do this is to draw around the outside of a 9 inch pan with a pencil.</li>

		<li>In a large bowl, beat egg whites on high speed until soft peaks form. Add 3/4 cup of the sugar gradually, while continuing to whip. Make sure sugar is completely dissolved. Mix together the remaining 1/4 cup sugar with the cornstarch; lightly fold into meringue with lemon juice.</li>

		<li>"Spread a layer of meringue to fit circle on parchment, approximately 1/4 inch thick. With remainder of mixture, pipe or spoon swirls around the edges to form a shallow bowl shape."</li>

		<li>"In a large bowl, combine the cream and half a cup of confectioners sugar, and whip until thickened. Decorate with fruit of your choice; strawberries are excellent."</li>
